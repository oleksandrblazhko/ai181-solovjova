|--|---|
|0  |Implement implicit jailbreak or rooting detection. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmtauthz#rooting-detection">https://aka.ms/tmtauthz#rooting-detection</a>|
|1  |Implement Certificate Pinning. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmtcommsec#cert-pinning">https://aka.ms/tmtcommsec#cert-pinning</a>|
|2  |Encrypt sensitive or PII data written to phones local storage. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmtdata#pii-phones">https://aka.ms/tmtdata#pii-phones</a>|
|3  |Obfuscate generated binaries before distributing to end users. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmtdata#binaries-end">https://aka.ms/tmtdata#binaries-end</a>|
|4  |Network level denial of service mitigations are automatically enabled as part of the Azure platform (Basic Azure DDoS Protection). Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th165a">https://aka.ms/tmt-th165a</a>. Implement application level throttling (e.g. per-user, per-session, per-API) to maintain service availability and protect against DoS attacks. Leverage Azure API Management for managing and protecting APIs. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th165b">https://aka.ms/tmt-th165b</a>. General throttling guidance, refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th165c">https://aka.ms/tmt-th165c</a>|
|5  |Store secrets in secret storage solutions where possible, and rotate secrets on a regular cadence. Use Managed Service Identity to create a managed app identity on Azure Active Directory and use it to access AAD-protected resources. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th166">https://aka.ms/tmt-th166</a>|
|6  |Restrict access to Azure App Service to selected networks (e.g. IP whitelisting, VNET integrations). Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th167">https://aka.ms/tmt-th167</a>|
|7  |Implement application level auditing and logging, especially for sensitive operations, like accessing secrets from secrets storage solutions. Other examples include user management events like successful and failed user logins, password resets, password changes, account lockouts and user registrations.|
|8  |Remove standard server headers to avoid fingerprinting. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th174a">https://aka.ms/tmt-th174a</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th174b">https://aka.ms/tmt-th174b</a>|
|9  |Ensure that only trusted origins are allowed if CORS is being used. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th176">https://aka.ms/tmt-th176</a>|
|10 |Restrict access to Azure Postgres DB instances by configuring server-level firewall rules to only permit connections from selected IP addresses where possible. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th153">https://aka.ms/tmt-th153</a>|
|11 |Enforce communication between clients and Azure Postgres DB to be over SSL/TLS by enabling the Enforce SSL connection feature on the server. Check that the connection strings used to connect to MySQL databases have the right configuration (e.g. ssl = true or sslmode=require or sslmode=true are set). Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th154a">https://aka.ms/tmt-th154a</a> Configure MySQL server to use a verifiable SSL certificate (needed for SSL/TLS communication). Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th154b">https://aka.ms/tmt-th154b</a>|
|12 |It is recommended to rotate user account passwords (e.g. those used in connection strings) regularly, in accordance with your organization's policies. Store secrets in a secret storage solution (e.g. Azure Key Vault).|
|13 |Restrict access to Azure Postgres DB instances by configuring server-level firewall rules to only permit connections from selected IP addresses where possible. Refer: <a href="https://aka.ms/tmt-th153">https://aka.ms/tmt-th153</a>|
